# Bundas Analysis

### Strathmore Datathon Challenge

The challenge required participants to implement a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store. More about the challenge can be read [here](STRATHMORE%20DATATHON%20CHALLENGE.pdf).

The processes involved in this study were data cleaning, data visualization, feature engineering and modelling. A multiple linear regression model was used to make the sales predictions.

Aside from the visualization in the notebook, some additional visualization was implemented with Tableau as shown [here](Visualization%20of%20how%20Different%20features%20affect%20Sales.pdf).
