# Bundas Analysis

### Strathmore Datathon Challenge

The challenge required participants to implement a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store. More about the challenge can be read [here.](STRATHMORE DATATHON CHALLENGE.pdf)

The processes involved in this study were data cleaning, data visualization, feature engineering and modelling. A multiple linear regression model was used to make the sales predictions.

Aside from the visualization in the notebook, some additional visualization was implemented with Tableau as shown [here.](Visualization of how Different features affect Sales.pdf)
